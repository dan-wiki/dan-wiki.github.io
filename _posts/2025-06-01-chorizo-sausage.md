### Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Heat Levels**: Omit chipotle for milder chorizo.
- **Fat Content**: Ensure 20–30% fat; add pork fatback if too lean.
- **Tangy Flavor**: Vinegar is essential—don’t skip.
- **Keep Cold**: Chill all parts to prevent fat smearing.
- **Tough Casings**: Briefly simmer before browning.
- **Dry Sausage**: Avoid overcooking; maintain fat levels.
- **Flavor Issues**: Taste-test and adjust salt or peppers as needed.
