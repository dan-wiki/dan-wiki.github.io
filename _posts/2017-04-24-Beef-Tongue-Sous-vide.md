## Ingredients



-   1 (2 to 3 pound) beef tongue

-   3 tablespoons ancho chili powder

-   2 tablespoons garlic salt

-   1 tablespoon ground cumin

-   1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper

-   1 tablespoon canola oil

-   18 corn tortillas, warmed for serving

-   1 white onion, finely diced

-   1 bunch cilantro, leaves picked

-   2 cups thinly sliced radishes

-   3 limes, cut into wedges



## Instructions

1.  Set the Sous Vide to 158ºF (70ºC).

2.  Season the tongue with chili powder, garlic salt, cumin, and pepper.

    Place in a large zipper lock or vacuum seal bag and seal using the

    water immersion technique or a vacuum sealer on the moist setting.

3.  Place the bag in the water bath and set the timer for 36 hours. You

    will likely need to add water every several hours to keep the water

    level above the tongue.



*Finishing Steps*



1.  When the timer goes off, remove the bag from the water bath. Remove

    the tongue from the bag and pat dry with paper towels. Remove the

    outer layer of the tongue. It should easily peel off.

2.  Separate the meat from any excess fat and shred or cut into small

    cubes.

3.  Heat the canola oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat.

    When the oil just begins to smoke, add the tongue. Sear, stirring

    occasionally, until golden brown, about 2 minutes.

4.  Serve the tongue on warmed tortillas (or keto alternatives such as

    boston luttuce), topped with onions, cilantro, radishes, and lime

    wedges.
