# Ingredients

* 1/2 cup plus 2 tbsp (150 g) ghee, butter, or other fat
* 1 very large or 2 med (200 g) onion
* 2 garlic cloves
* 14 oz (400 g) liver (beef, lamb, chicken, or otherwise)
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 1/2 tsp allspice, freshly ground (see above)
* 1/4 tsp pepper
* 2 tsp whipping cream (or milk alternative or I've even used water for dairy free)

# Instructions

1. Roughly chop onion and cook on low heat in ghee (or other fat) until caramelized, about 20 minutes.
2. Slice the liver, removing any membrane (white filmy layer).
3. Chop garlic and add to onion for about five minutes.
4. Using a slotted spoon, remove the onions and garlic to a food processor or high speed blender.
5. Cook the liver on med heat in the remaining fat, until no longer bloody.
6. Let the liver and fat cool for a few minutes, then add to food processor.
7. Add salt, allspice, pepper and cream (or milk alternative or even water).
8. Blend until smooth.
9. Line a container with plastic wrap and smooth the pate into the container so that when it chills, you can turn the container over and peel away the plastic wrap, making the pate slice-able.
10. Alternatively, as I've done here, just put the pate in a bowl or any vessel and scoop it out as needed.
11. Eat fresh or chill to harden and further meld flavours
