### Ingredients

- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 2 tbsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp ground cumin
- 1 tbsp dried oregano
- 3 garlic cloves, smashed

### Method

1. **Prep the Pork**  
   Pat the pork butt dry. In a small bowl, mix kosher salt, black pepper, cumin, and oregano. Rub this mixture all over the pork, working it into the scored skin.

2. **Slow Cook**  
   Place the pork in the slow cooker skin-side up. Add garlic, sliced onion, and broth around the pork (do not submerge the skin). Cover and cook on HIGH for 6–7 hours, until the meat is fork-tender or reaches ~195°F internally.

3. **Crisp It**  
   Preheat the oven to 450°F. Transfer the cooked pork to a baking sheet and shred into large chunks (save the crispy skin bits!). Drizzle with vegetable oil and toss lightly. Roast for 15–20 minutes, flipping once, until the edges are crispy and golden.

4. **Serve**  
   Shred further if desired. Serve hot with tortillas, lime wedges, cilantro, or toppings of your choice. The crispy skin is edible and delicious--don’t skip it!
