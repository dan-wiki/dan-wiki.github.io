### Method

1. **Prepare the Sweet Potato Mash**:
   - Peel and dice the sweet potatoes into large chunks.
   - Place them in a large pot of cold water, add a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Cook until the sweet potatoes are fork-tender (about 15-20 minutes). Drain and transfer to a large bowl.
   - Mash the sweet potatoes with a potato masher or use a hand mixer for a smoother texture.
   - Stir in the melted butter, heavy cream, maple syrup (or brown sugar), cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla extract, and salt. Adjust seasoning and sweetness to taste.

2. **Assemble the Dish**:
   - Preheat your oven to 200°C/400°F.
   - Transfer the mashed sweet potatoes into a 9x13-inch baking dish and smooth the top with a spatula.
   - Evenly sprinkle the mini marshmallows over the top. If using, also sprinkle the pecans and a little brown sugar for extra sweetness and crunch.

3. **Bake**:
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the marshmallows are golden and slightly toasted. Watch carefully to prevent burning.

4. **Serve**:
   - Let the dish rest for 5 minutes before serving. The marshmallows will stay gooey, making it the ultimate crowd-pleaser!
