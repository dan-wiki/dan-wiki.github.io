categories: I'm sorry, but as an AI text-based model, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access specific recipes. Therefore, I am unable to generate a python list object format based on a recipe title. However, if you provide me with the recipe title, I can help you extract the food names and cooking method names from it.
tags: Here is a Python list object format of the food names and cooking method names found in the given recipe:

```python
recipe_list = ['reddit.com', 'know']
```
