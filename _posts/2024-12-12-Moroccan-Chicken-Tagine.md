### Ingredients

- 1 Tbsp ground cumin
- 1 Tbsp ground coriander
- 1 Tbsp sweet smoked paprika
- 2 tsp kosher salt
- 1 Tbsp olive oil, divided
- 4 cups eggplant, diced (with peel)
- 1 lb uncooked boneless skinless chicken breast, cut into thin strips
- 2 cups onion, chopped or diced
- 1 cup yellow or orange pepper, diced
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 Tbsp minced ginger
- 15 oz canned diced tomatoes
- 15 oz canned chickpeas, rinsed and drained
- 14 dried apricot halves, chopped
- 1 cup canned tomato sauce
- 1/4 cup fresh mint leaves, chopped

### Instructions

1. Combine cumin, coriander, paprika, and salt in a small bowl to make a spice mix. Toss eggplant with 1 tsp oil and 1 tsp spice mix in a medium bowl.
2. Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper. Roast eggplant, stirring once halfway through, until browned, about 30–35 minutes.
3. While eggplant roasts, heat 1 tsp oil in a large sauté pan over medium-high heat. Sprinkle chicken with 1 tsp spice mix and add to the pan. Cook until browned and cooked through, about 5–7 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and set aside.
4. Heat remaining 1 tsp oil in the same pan. Add onion and pepper, cooking and stirring frequently until beginning to brown, about 3–4 minutes. Stir in garlic, ginger, and the remaining spice mix; cook for 1 minute. Add tomatoes, chickpeas, apricots, and tomato sauce. Stir to combine.
5. Add reserved chicken and roasted eggplant to the sauce. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes to blend flavors. Serve garnished with chopped mint.
