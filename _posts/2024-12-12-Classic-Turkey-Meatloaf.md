### Ingredients

- 2 Tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 cup minced onion
- 1 celery rib, minced
- 1 Tbsp minced garlic
- 1 carrot, minced
- 1/2 cup minced green onion (including the greens)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
- 1 tsp smoked paprika
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 2/3 cup ketchup, divided (1/3 for the mixture, 1/3 for topping)
- 2 lbs ground turkey
- 1 cup almond meal
- 2 large eggs, slightly beaten
- 1/3 cup minced fresh parsley leaves

### Method

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F, with a rack in the middle.

2. In a large, heavy skillet, melt the butter over medium heat until foamy. Add the minced onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and green onions. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Cover the skillet and cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the carrots are tender. Stir in salt, black pepper, smoked paprika, dried thyme, Worcestershire sauce, and 1/3 cup of ketchup. Cook for 1 more minute, then remove from heat and let cool to the touch.

3. In a large bowl, use clean hands to combine the ground turkey, almond meal, eggs, the cooked vegetables from step 2, and parsley.

4. Press the mixture into a loaf pan with 2-inch high sides, or form the mixture into a free-standing loaf and place in a rimmed roasting pan. Cover the top of the loaf with the remaining ketchup.

5. Bake the meatloaf in the preheated oven for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature of the meatloaf reaches 165°F. Let rest for 10 minutes. Then gently remove by lifting with a spatula to a serving plate, and slice to serve.
