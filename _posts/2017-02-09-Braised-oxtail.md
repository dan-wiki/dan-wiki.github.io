## Ingredients

-   5 to 6 pounds oxtails
-   Kosher salt and ground black pepper
-   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
-   1/2 cup shaoxing rice wine
-   1/3 cup tamari or soy sauce
-   1/3 cup molasses substitute (3 tbs (x3 tasters choice packets) instant coffee 1 tbsp splenda (x5 tbsp monk fruit juice)) or (sugar-free maple syrupt), \<1 oz water
-   2 cups water
-   1 tablespoon sugar substitute
-   6 star anise, broken into pieces
-   20 cloves or same worth of ground
-   3 scallions chopped
-   6 slices fresh peeled ginger
-   4 garlic cloves, smashed
-   1 tsp juiced orange
-   The zest of a half an orange


## Directions

1.  Make reduction sauce: Mix the soy sauce, sugar substitute,

    \"molasses\", water, star anise, cloves, scallions, ginger,

    peppercorns and garlic. Set aside

2.  Bring a cast-iron pan to high. Put the seasoned oxtail in the pan.

    Sear/brown/crisp on all sides -- 1 min per side. This will tighten

    the meat up so you don't lose tons of flavor

3.  Remove the oxtail and put in the slow cooker

4.  Deglace with shaoxing wine into the pan for 15-30 seconds

5.  Add in the reduction sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil.

6.  Agitate and mix. Turn off the heat.

7.  Add everything to the slow cooker for 5 hours on low.

8.  When the cartilage and tendon turn into a jelly you know it's done.

9.  Turn the heat off. Let rest for 30 min.

10. Grab the oxtail out of the liquid and put in the refrigerator

    overnight.

11. Drain the liquid through a sieve.

12. Put the liquid in the fridge as well.


*Next Day*

1.  Remove the fat layer. Now you have an "aspic"

2.  Heat the oven to about 325ยบ F.

3.  Cover the oxtail with foil and put it in the oven for 10 minutes.

4.  Heat the glaze/aspic on low and take the zest of half an orange and

    stir it in.

5.  Add a teaspoon of orange juice into the mix

6.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Drizzle over the oxtail. Garnish with onion

    and coriander.
