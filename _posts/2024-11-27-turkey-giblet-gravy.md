### Ingredients
- 1 jar (12 oz) Chicken-Flavored Gravy
- Roasted Turkey Giblets (neck, heart, and gizzard)
- Optional: Liver (roasted for the last 15-20 minutes)
- 1/4 cup Turkey Drippings
- 1/2 cup Water or Chicken Stock (optional, for thinning)
- 1 tbsp All-Purpose Flour or Cornstarch (optional, for thickening)
- Salt and Black Pepper, to taste

### Method

1. **Roast the Giblets**:
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Place the giblets (neck, heart, and gizzard) on a baking sheet or small roasting pan.
   - Roast for **45-60 minutes**, turning halfway through, until browned and fully cooked. Add the liver in the last **15-20 minutes** if using.

2. **Prepare the Giblets**:
   - Once roasted, chop the giblets into small, bite-sized pieces.
   - Reserve the neck meat by pulling it off the bone and discarding the neck bone.

3. **Combine the Base**:
   - In a medium saucepan over medium heat, warm the jar of chicken-flavored gravy.
   - Stir in the roasted giblets and any drippings from the turkey roasting pan (about 1/4 cup).

4. **Adjust Consistency**:
   - If the gravy is too thick, thin it out with water or chicken stock (up to 1/2 cup).
   - If it’s too thin, create a slurry by mixing 1 tbsp of flour or cornstarch with 2 tbsp water, and stir it into the gravy. Simmer until thickened.

5. **Season and Serve**:
   - Taste the gravy and season with salt and black pepper, if needed.
   - Serve warm over turkey, mashed potatoes, or stuffing.
