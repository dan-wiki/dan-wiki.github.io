## Ingredients



-   4 to 8 large eggs - (make sure they are very fresh; preferably, no

    more than a day old)



For the pickling solution



-   .5 cup Japanese soy sauce

-   .25 cup rice vinegar

-   2 tablespoons sugar (substitute/ or skip)

-   bowl riced cauliflower



## Instructions



1.  Choose a covered container that can hold all the egg yolks in a

    single layer.

2.  Crack the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites (you can

    freeze the egg whites for future use).

3.  Carefully drop the egg yolks into the container. Make sure they do

    not touch one another.

4.  Mix all the ingredients for the pickling solution until the sugar is

    dissolved.
