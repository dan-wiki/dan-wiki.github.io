## Method

### Step 1: Prepare the Brine and Cure the Tongue (5–14 Days)
1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil. Add kosher salt, sugar, curing salt, garlic, and spices. Stir until fully dissolved.  
2. Let the brine cool completely (refrigerate if needed).
3. Strain the brine throuhj a sieve.
4. Place the rinsed tongue in a large non-reactive container or zip-top bag. Pour cooled brine over to submerge. Use a weight if necessary.  
5. Refrigerate for 5–14 days, flipping every 2–3 days. 10 days yields classic deli-style flavor. Keep submerged and monitor daily.

### Step 2: Rinse and Cook the Tongue (2–6 Hours)
1. Remove tongue from brine and rinse thoroughly. Soak in cold water for 15–30 minutes, changing water a few times.  
2. Taste a small slice; if overly salty, soak longer.  
3. Place in a large pot with onion, garlic, carrot, celery. Cover with fresh water.  
4. Bring to boil, discard water, and repeat 2–3 times to reduce saltiness.  
5. Refill with fresh water and simmer covered for 2–3 hours (or roast at 250°F for 6 hours or pressure cook on high for 25–90 minutes depending on size).  
6. Tongue is done when fork-tender. Let cool slightly, then peel outer skin and remove any gristle.  
7. Slice thinly against the grain.

## Tips

- **Curing Salt**: Use Prague Powder #1 only as directed. Essential for safety and proper preservation.  
- **Storage**: Refrigerate cooked tongue for up to 5 days, or freeze sliced portions for 3 months.  
- **Variation**: For pastrami-style, smoke after curing before final cooking.  
- **Scaling**: Adjust brine and cooking time for larger tongues. Always cook to tenderness.
