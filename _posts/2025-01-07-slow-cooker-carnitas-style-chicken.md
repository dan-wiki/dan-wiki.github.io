ingredients:
  - 2-3 bone-in chicken leg quarters
  - 1-2 tsp cumin
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp dried oregano
  - 1 packet Saz처n Goya (with coriander and annatto)
  - 1-2 limes, juiced (add peels)
  - 1/2 cup chicken broth
  - Kosher salt, to taste
  - Black pepper, to taste
  - Optional: 1 tsp smoked paprika
steps:
  - In a small bowl, mix cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, Saz처n Goya, salt, and pepper.
  - Rub the spice mixture evenly over the chicken leg quarters.
  - Place the chicken in the slow cooker. Add lime juice, lime peels, and chicken broth.
  - Cover and set the slow cooker to "Low" for 6-8 hours, or until the chicken is tender and easily pulls apart.
  - Preheat the oven to 450째F (conv roast).
  - Transfer the cooked chicken to a baking sheet, skin-side up.
  - Brush with some cooking juices or oil for added crispiness.
  - Roast in the oven for 10-15 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. (Optional: Broil for 2-3 minutes for extra crispness.)
  - Serve with your favorite toppings or sides, like tortillas, salsa, and fresh cilantro.
notes:
  - The Saz처n Goya adds a vibrant flavor and color to the dish, enhancing the savory profile.
  - Keep an eye on the chicken during broiling to prevent burning.
  - Save all the remaining juice in mason jars and refrigerate overnight, seperate the top layer of fat and put in a pan on low heat and pour through a cheese clothe into another madon jar. This is schmaltz and is great to cook with  
  - The remaing liquid is broth and can be frozen and used in sauces or to make soup. It is liquid gold.
  - The bones can be frozen and used in a new stock. They won't yield as much collagen, so combine them with fresher bones when making the stock.
