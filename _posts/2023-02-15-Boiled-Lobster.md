# Ingredients

-   2 2 lb lobsters

-   16 qt pot (or more. Mine is 23qt)

-   water filling 3/4 of the pot

-   1 stick of butter

-   2 squeezes of lemon

-   1 tsp old bay for butter

-   1 tsp sea or kosher salt for butter

-   1 tbsp sea or kosher salt per quart of water

-   Large cutting board

-   2 platter dishes

-   2 large ramekins

-   2 small ramekins



# Instructions

1.  Bring salt water to a boil

2.  On a chopping board, kill the lobster by driving the knife down behind its head. See YouTube.

3.  Fold the tail down and put the lobster into the pot with it facing away suck that it can't flick and splash you. Put the lid on quick to help prevent this.

4.  Do the last two steps for the second lobster.

5.  Boil for 16 min. They should turn bright red.

6.  Ensure that the foam is removed with a spoon if it builds up on the water.

7.  When the lobster is done, remove them with metal tongs onto a pan. I'll sometimes use a disposable.

8.  Twist the arms off.

9.  Twist the tails off.

10. Use kitchen shears to cut the tail shell down the middle and plate the tail meat on a platter per lobster.

11. Gentle back-and-forth break the little index claws off the large claw so the little meat stays intact with the large claw meat.

12. Use a large heavy knife to smack the center of each claw then twist the divot created to cleanly break open the claw without cutting through it, so you can, remove the whole claw in one piece, and plate the meat on a platter per lobster.

13. Use kitchen shears to remove the arms meat and plate it. The kitchen shears are the best for this.

14. Remove all small legs and put in a bowl if anyone want to suck on the to remove the meat.

15. Open the head and scrape out the roe/eggs (red waxy stuff), tomalley/organ meat (green stuff), hemolymph/blood (white goopy stuff), and peel the thin layer of meat from the sides of the head and put that in a small ramekin for each lobster as well since that's tasty too.

16. Add half a stick of butter to each large ramekin. Melt the butter in the microwave and then add 1/2 tsp old bay, 1/2 tsp salt and a squeeze of lemon to each . You can optionally add chives to the butter or poultry herb mix.

17. Dip all that meat in the butter while eating and enjoy!
