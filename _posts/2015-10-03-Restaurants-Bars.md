##### MA

-   99 Restaurant, Greenfield, MA - Rating 4/10 - Was a chain restaurant
    comparable to Applebees or Ruby Tuesday\'s, but was much friendlier.
    Had a nice trivia night on Thursday. Got standard sirloin steak,
    melted butter. and broccoli. Missed prime rib nights apparently.
    Every night should be prime rib night.. Nothing special here.

-   The People\'s Pint, Greenfield, MA - Rating 8/10 - Farm to table
    food. Grass fed burger was cooked to perfection.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Hope and Olive, Greenfield, MA - Rating 7/10 - Farm to table type
    food. A little more gourmet than the People\'s Pint. The grass fed
    burger was not cooked to perfection and the waitress was confused
    when I asked if I could get a vegetable side with my burger. The
    cold antipasto was good.
