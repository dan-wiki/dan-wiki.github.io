- 2 teaspoons fine sea salt  
- ½ cup granulated sugar  
- 1 cup buttermilk  
- 2 large eggs  
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly

#### Topping (Glaze & Jalapeños)

### Method

1. **Preheat the Oven**  
   Set oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan (or similar) generously with butter or non-stick spray.

2. **Prepare the Glaze**  
   In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine honey and corn syrup. Simmer gently for 2–3 minutes until bubbling lightly. Remove from heat and whisk in cold butter pieces, one at a time, until smooth. Pour glaze evenly into prepared pan.

3. **Add Jalapeños**  
   Arrange jalapeño slices over the glaze in a single layer to cover the pan bottom.

4. **Make the Batter**  
   In a large bowl, whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar. In a separate bowl, whisk together buttermilk, eggs, and melted butter. Combine wet and dry ingredients with a spatula until just mixed (lumps are okay).

5. **Rest the Batter**  
   Let batter sit for 15 minutes to hydrate and thicken.

6. **Assemble and Bake**  
   Pour batter evenly over jalapeños in the pan. Smooth the top. Bake for 30–45 minutes, checking at 30 minutes. It's done when golden and a toothpick comes out clean.

7. **Cool and Invert**  
   Cool in pan for 10 minutes. Run a knife around edges, then invert onto a serving plate. Replace any stuck jalapeños. Let cool slightly before slicing.

### Tips

- **Spice Level**: Reduce jalapeños or remove seeds for milder heat.
- **Storage**: Wrap tightly. Store at room temp up to 2 days, or refrigerate up to 5 days. Reheat at 350°F for 5–10 minutes.
- **Serving Suggestion**: Pairs great with chili, grilled meats, or sour  cream.
