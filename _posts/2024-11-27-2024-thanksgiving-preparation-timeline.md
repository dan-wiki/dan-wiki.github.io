### **Tips**
- **Double Oven Users**:
  - Bake appetizers and sides in the second oven while the turkey roasts.
  - Use one oven at 325Â°F for the turkey and the other at 375Â°F for sides.
  
- **Stagger Baking Times**:
  - Bake casseroles and gratins in sequence if oven space is limited, keeping earlier dishes warm in a low oven (200Â°F) or covered with foil.

- **Delegate**:
  - Assign easy tasks like tossing the salad or setting up appetizers to guests who offer to help.
