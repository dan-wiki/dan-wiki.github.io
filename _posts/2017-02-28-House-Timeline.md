    electronic timer in on position

-   2017-02-27: Found that the outlet under the door lamp was on the

    same circuit controlled by the timer. Outlet was badly rusted, so

    was replaced. The electric then runs underground to a lamp by the

    walkway, which was broken, but had a good connection from the

    source. From that lamp, there looks to be a short to the lamp post.

    Need to dig there and find the box (or lack thereof) and have Milan

    replace it with a special tubed box that is to code, then will

    provide a new walkway lamp and lamp post/top since the old one is

    falling apart. Will also replace the door lamp as well in order to

    match. Added a USB charge receptacle to kitchen, replaced old creepy

    hanging light with outlet in the workshop in order to hang shop LED

    fixture. Kitchen cabinet underlighting needs electronic dimmer in

    order to get rid of flickering. - \$120 (Milan), \$40 parts

    drainage motor. - \$100 (Appliance Science)

-   2017-03-11: Removed outdoor log holder and logs from house and moved

    into woods until it could be dumped. Also had to remove a large

    leave pile around it. Underneath the pile was a pile of

    miscellaneous bricks and a cinder block, which were stacked next to

    the wood pile in the woods awaiting full removal. Researching

    cheaper ways to dispose of large junk.

-   2017-03-11: Did taxes and discussed benefits of home equity loans

    with accountant. Will need it in order to pay for gas conversion.

    That will provide the greatest tax advantage, if I role student loan

    debt into it. - \$250 (Jeorge)

-   2017-03-14: Major blizzard. Only issue was icing on walkway next

    day.

-   2017-03-15: Neighbor\'s kid\'s friend accidentally backed into

    mailbox, snapping it in half, then drove off. Was able to repair in

    the workshop and then spend a very long time shoveling. Need a

    better approach to clearing the driveway.

-   2017-03-16: Fridge water dispenser started leaking heavily. Home

    warranty claim in motion.

-   xxxx-xx-xx: Sears came out the next day and we found the shutoff

    valved for the fridge water in a door panel above the baseboard in

    the pub room. The water is hard and sediment built up throughout the

    fridge\'s water system. The leakage was from both ice buildup and

    sediment.

-   xxxx-xx-xx: Sears came back and replaced the reservoir and piece

    that directs the flow of water. Had to immediately change the filter

    in order to get rid of the cloudy water and not contaminate the new

    parts. After about two weeks, the water is almost as clear as the

    sink. - \$100

-   xxxx-xx-xx: Tested water levels. Negative for bacteria, lead,

    pesticides, and chlorine. Water is hard at 120ppm. Ph is higher end

    of normal at \~8ppm. Nitrate/Nitrite is .5 ppm and Nitrite is 0. So

    0..

-   2017-03-27: We are officially getting a dog on April 17th!

-   2017-04-03: Jamie (tree guy) came by to assess the tree situation.

    He said that it would be way too expensive for me to clean up

    everything in one go. Instead he recommended taking down a large

    tree that was overhanging the house and had a hole through it at the

    base, he was able to put his hand into the hole and pull out sawdust

    and show light through. He said that it was a matter of time before

    the tree came down and caused some major damage. There was another

    that had a very aggressive lean over the bedroom. He recommended

    taking these down and the one in front that was touching the roof

    and electrical line and was where the ant problem was found.

-   2017-04-04: Mr. Appliance came back to install the range exhaust

    hood and claimed that they could not because it was hard-wired and

    the new one required an outlet. Additionally, the duct was smaller

    than the new one, lastly, the grout would be torn up and tile damage

    may result. Considering my options.

-   2017-04-05: Jamie came back with a large crew that trimmed up the

    two large trees in front (more light to rid front lawn of moss), got

    rid of the pile of wood covered in thorn bushes by the shed/workshop

    and cut down the three trees that needed to go. They ground out the

    stumps of two out of the three trees (one stump was in rocks) as

    well as another stump in front by the walkway, one in back by the

    great room (from tree that fell on the porch during either Irene or

    Sandy resulting in the previous owner enclosing the porch) and

    another in the far back. \$2,400

-   2017-04-08: Milan stopped by could not figure out where the box

    connecting the lamps was. It looks like the line from the front door

    straddles the house, leading up to the driveway. I think that they

    put the line under the driveway. I\'m going to dig at the corner in

    order to find the box as time permits. He installed an LED dimmer in

    the master bath and then showed me that there was not enough room

    inside the exhaust hood duct cover for an outlet. Calling the

    manufacturer to discuss options. - \$25

-   2017-04-09: Jeff (landscaper) came and cleaned up the leaves in the

    front and back, trimmed all the shrubs and bushes, did something

    with a blower machine to the front lawn, and chopped down the ugly

    tall grass around the mailbox. \$450, will be \$50 a mowing 1-3

    times/mo in summer.

-   2017-04-10: Exterminator came and sprayed the backyard for ticks,

    fleas, mosquitos, ants, etc.. Sprayed the inside for everything

    else. Very nice people. After spraying, many spiders, etc came out,

    but now the flow of insects has tapered off significantly. All

    products used were natural and non-toxic. - (Arkardia) \~\$1150/yr

-   2017-04-17: We picked up our 11 week old AusieDoodle F1b (Poodle)

    puppy, Layla from the airport. Brought here out in a crate that said

    live cargo. Just like picking up baggage, but left with a new member

    of the family. She came from a reputable breeder in Kentucky.

    (Sunset Hill Farms) - \$1500 one-time cost, (Trupanion pet

    insurance) \$65/month. Many more monthly costs it seems.

-   2017-04-26: Almost done with flooring in guest room. Got nail gun

    and compressor and put back baseboards. Need to caulk and install

    quarter-round molding to hide expansion gap in Pergo. - \$150

    sufficient access in order to raise/mount new A/C unit into attic.

    \~\$800.

-   xxxx-xx-xx: Found exhaust fans are likely malfunctioning due to

    attic temperature. Got estimate for office closet re-insulation,

    tiling, and second attic access latter for the other half of the

    house. \~\$1300

-   xxxx-xx-xx: Carpenter ants are back in the office. Wasps and other

    bees are being harbored by rose/flower tree up against the house,

    which is letting them in when we open the Great Room door.

    Identified a wasp in the kitchen as a Spider Wasp. We have these

    because there is a spider problem. The spiders are here because of

    other bugs. Having Arkadia re-treat since we have unlimited.

-   2017-07-29: Found bird nest in oil input box, which the previous

    owner made look like a bird house.

-   2017-07-29: Got back to the Guest Room project. Bought more caulk,

    paint, and tools. Cleaned up previous caulking attempt after

    learning how to use a water bucket, finger, and sponge which allows

    for the removal of excess caulk from the wall without damaging the

    paint. There were not enough YouTube videos explaining this. Figured

    that the water would ruin the paint, but that is not the case at

    all. Needed to see it from a professional. Used 20 minute drying

    caulk. Don\'t buy the caulk tool kit from Home Deport. Was a waste

    of money. \~\$100
