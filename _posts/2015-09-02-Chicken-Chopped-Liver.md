## Ingredients



-   1 pound chicken livers, (preferably fresh)

-   6 tablespoon rendered chicken fat ( schmaltz), recipe follows

-   1 cup coarsely chopped onion

-   2 teaspoon kosher salt plus more

-   Freshly ground pepper

-   2 hard-cooked large eggs, finely chopped

-   Serving suggestion: Toasted rye or pumpernickel bread and cornichons



## Directions



1.  Rinse the livers and pat dry with a kitchen towel. Clean the livers,

    by trimming and discarding any visible fat, green parts, or

    membrane.

2.  Set the livers aside.

3.  In a large saute pan, over medium heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the

    smaltz or another fat and add the onions. Cook, stirring

    occasionally, until golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer

    the onions to a plate with a slotted spoon. Wipe out the pan.

4.  Spread the livers out in a single layer on a sheet pan and season

    with the salt and pepper.

5.  Raise the heat to high, add 2 tablespoons of the fat to the pan and

    when the fat begins to shimmer, lay the livers in the pan in a

    single layer.

6.  Working in batches, cook the livers turning each over once, until

    browned, about 2 to 2 1/2 minutes per side.

7.  Transfer the livers to the plate with the onions. Repeat with 2

    tablespoons fat and remaining livers. Cool.

8.  Coarsely chop the livers with a knife (don\'t be tempted to use a

    food processor).

9.  In a medium bowl, gently combine the livers with the eggs, onions,

    and remaining 2 tablespoons fat.

10. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

11. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving.

12. Serve with toast and cornichons if desired.
