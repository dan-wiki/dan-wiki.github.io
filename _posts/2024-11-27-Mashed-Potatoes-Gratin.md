### Method

1. **Prepare the Mash**:
   - Peel and dice the baking potatoes into chunks.
   - Place them in a large pot of cold water, add 1 tbsp salt, and turn the heat to high. Bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are knife-tender but not falling apart.
   - Drain in a colander and leave for 1 minute.
   - Immediately add the butter and cream to the pot and stir to melt the butter.
   - Add the drained potatoes and mash until smooth. Stir in the grated Cheddar and season with salt and pepper to taste.
   - Spoon the mash into a 25cm x 17cm (10” x 6.5”) baking dish and level off with a spoon. Preheat the oven to 200°C/400°F.

2. **Prepare the Gratin**:
   - Peel the potatoes and slice them in half lengthwise. Place each piece flat side down and thinly slice into half-moon shapes (about 1/8” thick).
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, garlic, salt, and pepper. Toss the sliced potatoes in this mixture, then coat them in half of the Parmesan.

3. **Assemble**:
   - Layer the potato slices cut-side-down on top of the mashed potatoes in 3 rows, slightly overlapping.
   - Cover with foil and bake for 20 minutes. Remove the foil, sprinkle the remaining Parmesan over the top, and bake for an additional 40 minutes, until the top is deep golden and crisp, and the potatoes are knife-tender.

4. **Finish**:
   - Let the dish rest for 15-20 minutes to allow the mash to retain its shape and for the sliced potatoes to finish cooking. It will remain piping hot for serving.
