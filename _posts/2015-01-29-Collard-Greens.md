**Ingredients**

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   3 slices bacon
-   1 large onion, chopped
-   2 cloves garlic, minced
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1 teaspoon pepper
-   3 cups chicken broth
-   1 pinch red pepper flakes
-   1 pound fresh collard greens, cut into 2-inch pieces


**Directions**

1.  Heat oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add bacon, and cook

    until crisp. Remove bacon from pan, crumble and return to the pan.

    Add onion, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add garlic, and

    cook until just fragrant. Add collard greens, and fry until they

    start to wilt.

2.  Pour in chicken broth, and season with salt, pepper, and red pepper

    flakes. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 45 minutes, or

    until greens are tender.
