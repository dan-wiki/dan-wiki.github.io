## Time & Temp {#time_temp}



-   Overnight Prep

-   1 hour 15 minutes @ 300F



## Ingredients



-   2 average racks pork ribs (800g / 1.8 lb / 28.2 oz)

-   1 medium shallot (60g / 2.1 oz)

-   2 cloves garlic

-   1 tsp cumin

-   1 tsp paprika

-   1 tsp chili powder

-   1/4 cup olive oil (60 ml / 2 fl oz)

-   1 tsp salt (smoked works best)

-   1/4 freshly ground pepper (I used white)



## Directions



1.  Prepare the ribs the night before (or at least a couple of hours in

    advance). First, chop them into pieces.

2.  Now, let\'s prepare the marinade. Place all other ingredients in a

    blender and pulse until smooth.

3.  Cover the ribs in the prepared marinade and place them in the fridge

    overnight (or at least a few hours).

4.  Preheat the oven to medium-low 150 C / 300 F. Place the marinated

    ribs in the oven and cook slowly for 60-75 minutes.

5.  When the ribs are cooked, turn the oven off and take them out. You

    can also half-open the oven and leave the ribs in until you\'re

    ready to eat. You can serve them with [Low Carb BBQ

    Sauce
