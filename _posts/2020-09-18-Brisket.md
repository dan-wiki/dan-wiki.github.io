## Ingredients



-   4 lb Brisket

-   1 env Lipton or Knorr french or regular onion soup mix

-   1 12oz can or bottle of beer (Corona light works fine)

-   1/2 cup ketchup

-   1/2 can whole cranberry sauce

-   salt

-   pepper

-   granulated garlic powder



**Note:** Recipe can be multiplied except the amount of beer stays the

same. Just use the closest multiple for the number of pounds.



## Directions



-   Place brisket in tin pan with the fat back downwards

-   Salt pepper and garlic brisket heavily

-   Mix all other ingredients except beer and pour over brisket so it

    sits evenly across the top

-   Can let sit in the fridge overnight

-   Pour beer into bottom of pan and make sure that it fully surrounds

    brisket. Use more if it does not.

-   Cover pan tightly with aluminum foil

-   Bake @ 275F for 1 hour per pound in the middle rack

-   Take foil off and let sit in juices for 45 minutes to an hour



**Note:** The brisket will effectively be braised and will fall apart in

large chunks like pulled pork. Suitable also for sandwiches. I suspect

that at 250F or 225F for the same amount of time will result in a

brisket that can be cut into strips.
