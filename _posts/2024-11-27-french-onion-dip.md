### Method

1. **Caramelize the Onions**:
   - Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt the butter or add olive oil.
   - Add the diced onions and cook slowly, stirring occasionally, until they turn golden brown and caramelized (about 15-20 minutes). Lower the heat if they start to brown too quickly.
   - Remove the onions from heat and let them cool completely.

2. **Mix the Dip**:
   - In a medium bowl, combine sour cream, mayonnaise, Worcestershire sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.
   - Fold in the cooled caramelized onions, mixing well.

3. **Chill**:
   - Cover the dip and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to let the flavors meld.

4. **Serve**:
   - Garnish with fresh chives, if desired.
   - Serve with potato chips, vegetable sticks, or crackers.
