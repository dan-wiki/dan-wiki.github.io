## Ingredients



-   8 ounces chicken fat and/or skin, cut into small pieces

-   1 sprig fresh thyme or 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme

-   1 clove garlic, minced

-   2 tablespoons cold water



## Directions



1.  In a small saucepan combine the chicken fat or skin, thyme, garlic,

    and water.

2.  Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low to medium heat.

3.  Cook until the fat has rendered (liquefied) and the skin becomes

    crispy, about 35 to 45 minutes.

4.  (Adjust the heat, as needed, to keep the skin from browning too

    quickly.)

5.  Set the chicken fat aside to cool slightly. Strain into a small

    bowl.

6.  If desired reserve the crispy skin. Refrigerate, covered, for up to

    one week.



-   Cook\'s Note: Trim chicken fat and skin from whole birds before

    roasting and store in the freezer until there is enough to render.


-   Yields: about 1/2 cup
