-   My current routine (\~25 minutes once to twice a week):

1.  Put blade into razor.

2.  Wash face with prep soap (if showering beforehand, I\'ll usually use

    CeraVe face wash instead of the Musgo).

3.  Hold towel with hot water to beard for about 2 minutes.

4.  Apply shave oil thoroughly.

5.  Fill sink and inside scuttle with hot water.

6.  Wet brush and let out a shake\'s worth of water.

7.  Put nickle worth of shave cream into scuttle and build lather to rich foam.

8.  Brush cream into face in order to exfoliate and build foam further. Use paintbrush method to apply an even layer.

9.  Shave down

10. Reapply lather

11. Shave across, inwards

12. Reapply cream

13. Shave across, outwards

14. Rinse then apply skin food

15. Do wet pass to touch up. Apply j-hook and blade buffing where applicable.

16. Rinse and apply alum with head of block wet.

17. Clean sink area

18. Rinse and apply witch hazel and let it dry a little

19. Apply after shave

20. Rinse shave brush, wring it out, and dry.

21. Apply after-shave balm.

22. Dispose of blade in blade bank.

23. Rinse razor in rubbing alcohol.
