## Ingredients

-   Dry Rub
    -   1 tsp Salt
    -   2 tsp sugar substitute
    -   1 tsp 5 spice powder
    -   1/2 tsp pepper

-   Cure
    -   2 tsp salt
    -   1 tsp vinegar


## Instructions

1.  Wash pork belly
2.  Put in cookware with drip tray
3.  Cut into belly side (finger deep scores)
4.  Poke small holes in skin side
5.  Cut shallow grooves into the skin
6.  Rub dry run into belly side (not on skin)
7.  Wipe down and dry the skin
8.  Layer the cure over the skin
9.  Leave in fridge for at least 3 hours (optional)
10. Put in oven on 400F for 20 minutes (skin down) (\#1)
11. Turn skin up
12. Pat dry again
13. Add cure again
14. Put in oven again for 20 minutes (\#2)
15. Pat dry again
16. Add cure again
17. Put in oven again for 20 minutes (\#3)
18. If the skin hasn\'t crisped yet, put back in for 5-10 minutes at a
    time. Potentially put closer to the top heating element and up to
    425F.
19. Rest for about 15 minutes before cutting
20. Cut long-wise and then cut those into rectangular pieces



## Notes

-   The cure is mostly salt. It like a slurry. You are essentially brushing a salt paste onto the skin.
-   Some people cook over vegetables.
-   Some people just put a little oil and salt on the skin and don\'t keep removing from the oven and adding cure.
