## Ingredients



-   5 lbs. beef ribs

-   2 tablespoons chili powder

-   1 tablespoon each of oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme,

    salt

-   1/2 tablespoon pepper

-   1 teaspoon of allspice

-   1/4 teaspoon of cayenne (you can add more if you like heat -- this

    amount of cayenne just adds flavor, no heat)

-   Low Carb BBQ Sauce (optional)



This rub recipe makes about 1/2 cup of spice mix and will give you

plenty of rub for 5 lbs of ribs.



## Directions



Combine the dry spices to make the dry rub. Poke slits with a sharp

knife in the back membrane of the ribs (this allows the flavors in the

rub to penetrate the ribs). Rub the dry rub generously onto each side of

the ribs. Pack the ribs in the slow cooker and cook 6 to 8 hours on low.

These are very forgiving and can be cooked longer if needed. No liquid

is needed for this recipe. Try and place the ribs in the slow cooker

vertically in a circle pattern for even cooking.
