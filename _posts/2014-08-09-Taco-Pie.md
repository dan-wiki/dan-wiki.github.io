## Ingredients



-   See-through Pyrex baking pan (so you can see the layers) approx.

    16in. x 8in.

-   Colander (not required)

-   Rubber spatula (not required)

-   Mixing bowl

-   3oz Taco Seasoning

-   2lbs ground beef

-   1.5 15.5oz jars of salsa

-   2.5 8oz sticks of cream cheese

-   1 8oz bag of cheddar or Mexican mix cheese

-   1 tbsp olive olive

-   1.5 cups of water



## Directions



1.  Put olive oil in big pan and turn range on medium-high

2.  Cook meat evely in pan until browned while chopping and making sure

    it doesn\'t burn on bottom

3.  Drain fat from pan into sink (using the colander makes this easier)

4.  Add Taco Seasoning and water, keep

    mixing while bringing to a boil on high heat then reduce to medium

5.  Let simmer for 5 minutes while mixing frequently then remove from

    heat

6.  Preheat oven to 350F

7.  Layer bottom of pan evenly with cream cheese using a spatula, knife

    or spoon

8.  At this point, I like to wipe the edges so that the layer is flush

    and does not bleed into the next layer when you look at the pan at

    an angle

9.  Mix salsa with ground beef

10. Create an even layer with the meat mixture

11. Create an even layer with the cheese

12. Cook in oven on 350F for 25-30 minutes (do not let cheese burn or it

    will be harder to dip into the \"pie\" later)

13. Serve with veggie sticks such as celery, cucumber, broccoli,

    cauliflower, jicama, or (for the non-low-carbers) tortilla chips
