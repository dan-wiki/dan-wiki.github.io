**Ingredients**

-   1 leg of lamb, bone in (about 6 to 7 1/2 pounds)
-   1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
-   8 cloves garlic, minced
-   3 tablespoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves
-   1 tablespoon salt
-   2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper



**Directions**

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.

1.  Using your hands, rub the lamb all over with the lemon juice. Pat

    the garlic and rosemary evenly all over the surface of the meat. Put

    small slits in meat rub seasoning into them and insert garlic

    quarters. Season the meat with the salt and pepper and place the

    lamb in a roasting pan. Place the lamb in the oven and roast for 30

    minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and continue

    to cook for about 1 hour longer for medium-rare, or until a meat

    thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers about

    145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (be careful that the thermometer does

    not touch the bone.) Remove lamb from pan and allow to rest for 10

    to 15 minutes before carving.

2.  Position the roasting pan over your stove burners. Add mixed herbs

    and onions to pan, and stir to combine with pan drippings. Add

    chicken stock and wine to deglaze the pan, scraping the bottom with

    a wooden spoon to release any fond. Reduce over high heat until

    sauce consistency. Strain before serving, if desired. Slice lamb and

    serve with sauce drizzled over the top.



**Sauce**

-   1 cup chopped fresh herbs (combination of rosemary, chives, and parsley)
-   2 cups diced onions
-   2 cups chicken stock
-   1 cup red wine
