#### ðŸ¥‡ **Preferred Method: Pressure Fryer (KFC-Style)**

1. **Prep the Seasoned Flour**:
   - In a large bowl, whisk together all dry spices and cake flour.
   - Add salt and MSG last, after cardamom is well incorporated.

2. **Dredge the Chicken (7-10-7 Method)**:
   - Pat chicken pieces dry with paper towels.
   - Dredge each piece in seasoned flour for 7 seconds.
   - Let rest on a rack or tray for 10 seconds.
   - Dredge again for another 7 seconds and set aside.

3. **Heat the Pressure Fryer**:
   - Add **6â€“8 cups (1.5â€“2 quarts)** of **lard** to the pressure fryer.
   - Heat to **350Â°F (175Â°C)**, ensuring you do not exceed the fryerâ€™s max fill line.

4. **Cook**:
   - Carefully add chicken pieces to hot lard.
   - Lock the lid and bring to full pressure.
   - Fry under pressure for **10â€“12 minutes**.
   - Release pressure safely and remove chicken.
   - Ensure internal temp reaches **165Â°F (74Â°C)**.

5. **Rest & Serve**:
   - Let chicken rest on a wire rack for 5â€“10 minutes before serving.

#### ðŸ¥ˆ **Alternate Method: Standard Deep Fryer (Lard Only)**

1. **Prep as above**.

2. **Heat lard** in your fryer to **325Â°F (163Â°C)**. Use **6â€“8 cups** to fully submerge chicken.

3. **Fry in batches**:
   - Cook for **13â€“16 minutes**, turning halfway through.
   - Check internal temp -- should reach **165Â°F**.

4. **Drain & Rest**:
   - Place on a wire rack or paper towels to rest and crisp up.

#### ðŸ¥‰ **Skillet Method (Cast Iron or Heavy Skillet)**

1. **Prep chicken with 7-10-7 method**.

2. **Heat lard** to **325Â°F (163Â°C)** in a cast iron or heavy-bottomed skillet.  
   - Add enough to create **about 1/2 inch depth** (usually **1.5â€“2 cups** lard).

3. **Fry in batches**:
   - Place chicken skin-side down.
   - Fry for **7â€“8 minutes per side**, adjusting heat to prevent burning.
   - Use a lid or splatter guard as needed.
   - For thick pieces, finish in a 350Â°F oven until internal temp reaches **165Â°F**.

4. **Drain & Rest**:
   - Place on wire rack. Rest 5â€“10 minutes before serving.

**Notes:**
- All methods rely on **lard only** for frying -- no substitutions.
- Use **bone-in, skin-on chicken** only for authentic flavor and texture.
- The spice blend yields a deeply savory, classic fried chicken profile with cardamom as the secret standout.
