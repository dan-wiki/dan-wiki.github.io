### Instructions

* To begin, wash the ribs and pat them dry.
* You'll want to peel the membrane off the inside (boney side) of the slabs. This can be tricky to start, but once a corner has been loosened, the rest usually rips right off. The membrane is a slightly shiny thick paper-like layer covering the ribs. Slide a small knife into one corner of the ribs, just between the meat and membrane. I usually use a butter knife for this (a sharp knife may cut through the membrane, when I see this as more of a "prying" effect). Jiggle and push and shove the knife between the meat and membrane, sliding it from side to side, until roughly 1 inch of membrane has been loosened enough to hold on to. With a towel, grab the flap and with consistent force, peel the membrane off the inside of the slab. It "should" come off in one nice tear. If it doesn't, continue the prying and pulling process, until the entire membrane has been removed. Discard the membrane, cut the slab in half (creating to half-racks) set the slabs aside and repeat for the second slab.
* In a blender or food processor, puree the mustard, garlic and onion to make a paste. Rub the mustard paste all over the outside of the pork.
* Mix the remaining ingredients (except the BBQ Sauce) in a bowl.
* Liberally coat the pork with the dry rub.
* Pour about 1/4 cup of the BBQ sauce on the bottom of a slow cooker, then set it on low. Add one half rack to the slow cooker, then pour about 1/4 cup over the top of the rack. With a spoon, coat the rack with the sauce. Then, place a second half rack on top of the first. Coat it with about 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce. Continue layering the half racks until all the BBQ sauce and ribs are added.
* Cook the ribs for about 2 hours. After 2 hours, take the 2 half racks on the bottom of the slow cooker and place them on the top. This will more evenly distribute the heat, inside.
* Cook the ribs for a further 3 hours. Take the 2 half racks on the bottom of the slow cooker and place them on the top. This will once again distribute the heat, inside.
* After about 8 hours of total cooking time, turn off the slow cooker. Remove the ribs and keep somewhere warm. With a large spoon or ladle, scoop the pork fat off the top and discard. Pour the BBQ liquid into a soup pot and place on a hot burner, on the stove. Let it boil.
* Once the sauce reduces and thickens, serve it with the ribs
