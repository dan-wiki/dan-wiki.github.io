### Ingredients

- 1 medium butternut squash (2–3 lbs), peeled, seeded, and cut into uniform ¾–1 inch cubes (about 6 cups)
- 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil (or browned butter for extra richness)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or 1 tablespoon fresh)
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg (freshly grated if possible)
- 1–2 teaspoons maple syrup (for glossy caramelization)
- 2–3 garlic cloves, minced (optional, for savory depth)
- 1 tablespoon fresh sage or rosemary, chopped (optional, for herbaceous pop)
- **Finishing touches**:
  - Drizzle of balsamic glaze or lemon juice
  - ¼ cup toasted pepitas, crushed hazelnuts, or shaved Parmesan for crunch

### Method

1. **Preheat the Oven**  
   Position rack in the center and preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly oil it. Use two sheets if needed to prevent crowding.

2. **Prep the Squash**  
   In a large bowl, toss squash cubes with olive oil (or browned butter), salt, pepper, thyme, nutmeg, maple syrup, garlic, and herbs until evenly coated.  
   _Tip: Uniform cuts ensure even roasting--no big or small stragglers._

3. **Arrange and Roast**  
   Spread squash in a single layer on the baking sheet, with space between pieces for maximum caramelization. Roast for 20–30 minutes, flipping halfway through. The squash is done when fork-tender and golden with crispy edges.

4. **Finish Like a Chef**  
   Remove from the oven and let cool slightly for 2 minutes. Drizzle with balsamic glaze or lemon juice for brightness, then sprinkle with crunchy toppings like toasted nuts or cheese. Toss gently and serve.
