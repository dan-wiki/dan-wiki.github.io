## Recipe: Pulled Pork

### Yield: 8 or So Serves

### Cooking Time: ~5 Hours

### Ingredients

* 2.1Kg (4.6lbs) Pork Shoulder
* Paprika
* Salt
* Pepper
* Cumin
* Cinnamon

I decided that it was time to make pulled pork. I had *never* made it before, so I took to the internet to do research. Suffice to say, there are an immeasurable number of ways to do the job. Some use the skin, some don’t, some use beer, others might use root beer, and then some may even marinade in brine overnight. And of course, some do none of those things.

So, being out of my comfort zone already by roasting Pork, I made it up as I went, and it kicked ass*.

### Ingredients

Just Pork at this stage, unadulterated, fatty, beautiful.

### Step 1: Score the Skin

Get the sharpest knife in your arsenal, and score the skin. Ideally you will cut through the fat but not into the meat. Again, make sure you’re using the sharpest knife you have, I freshly sharpened my Globals and still had a hard time getting the job done.

### Step 2: Create a Rub

I used Paprika, Cumin, Cinnamon, Salt, and Pepper. And that smelt exactly like Taco Seasoning!

### Step 3: Get Rubbing!

Rub the spice mix into the meat, working it until it’s very well covered, here’s a side by side comparison.

If your hand looks like this, that’s a good sign

### Step 4: Roasting, Phase One

Preheat an oven to **at least** 220ºC, but don’t be afraid to take it up to 250ºC or more. Place the pork in for half an hour. It should go from this:

### Step 5: Roasting, Phase Two

Turn your oven down to 160-180ºC, cover the dish snugly with foil, and put it back in for a further 4.5 hours. Here’s how it should come out

Gorgeous.

### Step 6: Pulling Pork

Use two forks or whatever suits you, and start pulling it apart. Note the crackling off to the left here
