### Method

1. **Prepare the Chicken**  
   - If the chicken breasts are thick, slice them in half horizontally or pound to even thickness (1/4–1/2 inch) between plastic wrap or parchment.  
   - Season both sides with salt, black pepper, and garlic powder (if using).  
   - Dredge each piece in flour, shaking off any excess.

2. **Cook the Chicken**  
   - Heat 2 tbsp olive oil and 2 tbsp butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.  
   - Cook the chicken in batches to avoid overcrowding, 3–4 minutes per side, until golden and cooked through (internal temp: 165°F).  
   - Transfer to a plate and tent with foil. Add more oil if needed for the remaining pieces.

3. **Make the Sauce**  
   - In the same skillet, pour in white wine (or broth substitute) and scrape up the browned bits. Simmer 1–2 minutes.  
   - Add chicken broth, lemon juice, and capers. Simmer another 2–3 minutes until slightly thickened.  
   - Whisk in the remaining 2 tbsp butter to finish. Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice to taste.

4. **Combine and Serve**  
   - Return the chicken to the pan and spoon sauce over the top. Let it heat through for 1–2 minutes.  
   - Garnish with fresh parsley and lemon slices.  
   - Serve immediately with pasta, rice, or crusty bread.

### Tips

- For a gluten-free version, use a 1:1 gluten-free flour substitute.
- If the sauce is too tart, add a pinch of sugar or more butter to mellow it.
- Leftovers keep well for up to 2 days in the fridge; reheat gently to avoid drying out the chicken.
