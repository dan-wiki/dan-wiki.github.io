# Ingredients

-   1 Large egg (as local and organic as you can find)

-   .5 tsp salt

-   1.5 tbps water

-   1 tbsp lemon juice

-   2 tsp dijon mustard or other mustard

-   1 tsp white or apple cidar vinegar

-   1 cup olive, macadamia, or avocado oil. It needs to be quality and

    light or there will be a bad aftertaste

-   Immersion blender with blender attachment

-   Cylindrical container, like a mason jar, beaker, or Chinese food

    quart-size soup container.


# Instructions

1.  Choose:

    1.  Option 1: Pasteurize egg (recipe stays in fridge likely a month,

        maybe two)

        1.  Bring sous vide to 165F

        2.  Place egg in sous vide for 10 minutes

        3.  Pull egg out and check with laser thermometer that egg is in

            160\'s.

    2.  Option 2: Buy pasteurized/irradiated eggs (same shelf life as

        option 1, maybe better)

    3.  Option 3: Don\'t pasteurize (stays in fridge for about a week)

2.  Crack egg and extract yolk

3.  Run yolk under warm water for a few seconds if not using a method

    that already warmed the egg

4.  Add yolk, water, lemon juice, vinegar, and oil to container

5.  Blend on high, moving up and down and around after the emulsion

    starts to form

6.  Add salt (or sriracha) and run on high while mixing. Taste and

    reapply as needed

7.  Store in same container with lid


## Troubleshooting

-   You need to have some water, lemon juice, or vinegar from the start

    or it absolutely won\'t work.

-   The cold yolk makes it more runny, which may make it harder to

    emulsify.

-   If the emulsion breaks, redo the recipe in a new container, but

    substitute the old mixture for half of the oil and then when it all

    takes hold, start adding even more of the old mixture.
