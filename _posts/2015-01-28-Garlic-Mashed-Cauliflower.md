# Ingredients

-   1 medium head cauliflower
-   1 tablespoon cream cheese, softened
-   1/4 cup grated Parmesan
-   1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
-   1/8 teaspoon straight chicken base or bullion (may substitute 1/2 teaspoon salt)
-   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh or dry chives, for garnish
-   3 tablespoons unsalted butter



# Instructions 

1.  Set a stockpot of water to boil over high heat.

2.  Clean and cut cauliflower into small pieces. Cook in boiling water

    for about 6 minutes, or until well done. Drain well; do not let cool

    and pat cooked cauliflower very dry between several layers of paper

    towels.

3.  In a bowl with an immersion blender, or in a food processor, puree

    the hot cauliflower with the cream cheese, Parmesan, garlic, chicken

    base, and pepper until almost smooth.

4.  Garnish with chives, and serve hot with pats of butter.

5.  Hint: Try roasting the garlic and adding a little fresh rosemary for

    a whole new taste.
