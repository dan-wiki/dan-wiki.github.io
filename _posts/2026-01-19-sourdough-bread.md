## Equipment
- Digital scale  
- Mixing bowl  
- Jar or beaker for starter/levain  
- Dough scraper or bench knife  
- Bannetons (proofing baskets) or lined bowls  
- Dutch oven (5-7 qt)  
- Instant-read thermometer  
- Lame or sharp knife for scoring  
- Parchment paper  
- Oven mitts  

## Starter

- 50g whole wheat flour  
- 50g water  

**Steps:**
1. Add to beaker and mix.
2. Remove half after 24 hours (save the discarded portion in a separate jar in the fridge to accumulate for recipes like sourdough pancakes, tortillas, or crackers) and add back in with equal parts flour and water.
3. When it rises by half consistently, is bubbly on the surface, has a tangy smell, and passes the float test (a small piece floats in water), it's ready to use.
4. Feed daily at room temp, or store in fridge and feed weekly. (Note: If creating a starter from scratch, this process typically takes 5-7 days of daily feedings.)

## Bread Levain

- 45g starter  
- 45g stone-ground whole wheat flour  
- 45g unbleached all-purpose flour  
- 90g filtered water at room temperature (~73°F)

**Steps:**
1. Stir together ingredients in a jar. (You can use starter straight from the fridge.)
2. Place near a 78°F heat source.
3. Wait 6 hours, or until it doubles in volume, becomes bubbly, and passes the float test. If you miss the peak activity window (when it's risen close to its maximum, alive, and bubbly), feed it again with equal parts flour and water (e.g., 50g each) and wait a few more hours until it reaches peak again. In a pinch, if it's been fed multiple times over a day or two (e.g., twice with 50g flour and 50g water), you can use the entire levain in the dough mixture--it can still work well, though extra levain may lead to a faster bulk fermentation (monitor cues like the poke test closely).

## Bread Dough

- 500g unbleached all-purpose flour  
- 275g unbleached bread flour  
- 175g stone-ground whole wheat flour  
- 660g warm water (90–95°F)  
- All of the levain from above

**Steps:**
1. Hand mix all ingredients except levain until fully hydrated adding a little water as needed (it doesnt need to be perfect and will look messy). Do not knead. Wait 1 hour (autolyse).
2. Add levain and spread across dough with wet hands. Dimple in with fingers and pinch to incorporate.
3. Scoop and slap for 2 minutes using Rubaud method.
4. Cover bowl with towel and wait 20 minutes.
5. Add 1/4 cup 90-95°F water and 18g sea salt. (You can microwave water for 15 second bursts and use thermometer.)
6. Dimple and incorporate with Rubaud method like before.
7. Cover bowl with towel and wait another 20 minutes for the dough to hydrate again.
8. Take out of bowl onto counter and slap, turn and fold over until it becomes smooth in 3-5 minutes. (Dough should feel elastic and pass a basic windowpane test: stretch a small piece thin without tearing.)
9. Bulk ferment in bowl at 78°F for 3–4 hours until doubled, incorporating folds during the first 2 hours to build strength: After the initial 30-minute rest (post-slap-and-fold), perform a set of 4 folds/rotates in the bowl (use wet hands to prevent sticking). Repeat every 30–45 minutes for 3–4 sets total. Then let rise undisturbed for the remaining 1–2 hours. (Check with poke test: dough springs back slowly.) A dough proofer warming box is ideal.

## After Bulk Ferment

1. Carefully transfer dough onto flourless surface. (Might need a little flour if it's sticky.)
2. Divide in half using a dough scraper or bench knife: Use a turning wrist motion to slice through rather than just pressing down and pushing sideways--this makes dividing easier since the dough is stretchy. Then pre-shape into round balls by using the scraper to go around the edges, turning and tucking the dough under itself in a circular motion to build tension and form a tight ball.
3. Cover with overturned glass bowl for 15 minutes (this prevents the still-gooey dough from migrating or spreading out, helping it maintain the ball shape).  
4. Let sit uncovered for 10 minutes.  
5. Flour bannetons with rice flour.  
6. Dust dough balls with regular flour.  
7. Flip dough, roll like a burrito: stretch sides, coil and tighten by pulling inward (use bench scraper to drag dough toward you for better surface tension).  
8. Place in bannetons seam side up.  
9. Cover with plastic or zip bag secured with rubber band.  
10. Refrigerate for 8-15 hours max (there is some variability depending upon how established the starter is, but less might be better). The fridge boosts sourness and there is a spring effect when cooking from chilled (After fridge time, dough should feel puffy and pass poke test before baking.)

## Baking

1. Place Dutch oven in cold oven and preheat to 500°F for 1 hour.  
2. Dust bottom of loaf with cornmeal.  
3. Flip loaf onto parchment paper.  
4. Score top in a cross-hatch pattern (use a lame or sharp knife at a 45° angle for better oven spring).  
5. Place loaf on parchment paper into Dutch oven. (Use oven mitts--Dutch oven is extremely hot.)  
6. Bake 20 minutes with lid on.  
7. Reduce temp to 475°F and remove lid. Bake another 25–30 minutes, or until internal temperature reaches 205-210°F.  
8. Let rest 1 hour before slicing (full flavor develops after 24 hours).  
9. Store outside the fridge in a bread bag (lasts 3-5 days at room temp; freeze slices for longer).  
10. Repeat for second loaf, or freeze shaped dough for later.

## Notes/Troubleshooting
- Total time: ~24-36 hours, including waits; active time ~1-2 hours.  
- If dough is too sticky: Reduce water slightly next time (e.g., by 20–30g for easier handling) or ensure proper folding for structure.  
- Underproofed (dense crumb): Extend proof time. Overproofed (flat loaf): Shorten proof or check starter activity.  
- Flour substitutions: Can use all all-purpose if no bread flour available, but adjust hydration as needed.  
- No Dutch oven? Bake on a baking sheet with a steam tray (pan of water in oven) for the first 20 minutes.
- Temperature control: Maintain 75–78°F during bulk for consistent fermentation; warmer temps may require shorter bulk to avoid over-fermentation and deflation.  
- Starter strength: Use levain at peak activity for better rise; if dough slumps, consider fewer folds or a stronger starter next time.
