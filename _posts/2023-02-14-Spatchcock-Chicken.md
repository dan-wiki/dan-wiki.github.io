## Ingredients



For chicken:



-   \~5 lb whole chicken

-   2 tsp kosher salt

-   1/4 tsp black pepper

-   1/2 tsp olive oil

-   1/2 tsp Sazonador Goya

-   1 tsp Smoked Paprika



For Compound Butter:



-   4 Tbsp salted butter, softened

-   1 Tbsp olive oil

-   1 Tbsp Sazonador Goya

-   2 garlic cloves, minced

-   1/2 tsp lemon zest

-   1 Tbsp lemon juice

-   1 tsp kosher salt

-   1/8 tsp black pepper



## Directions



-   Mix all compound butter ingredients together in a bowl until they

    are uniformly distributed in the butter. Careful to add the lemon

    juice slowly to not let it get too watery. It's still useable if it

    is liquidy. You can also use a small food processor for this step.

-   Spatchcock the chicken by cutting the spine out then scoring the

    breast plate and pressing until it breaks. You can look up how to do

    this on YouTube.

-   Gently separate the skin from the meat to create pockets for the

    butter.

-   Spread the butter in the pockets of skin.

-   Pat the skin dry with a paper towel and spread some of the butter on

    the top of the skin.

-   Rub a little olive oil on the skin if butter is not evenly

    distributed across it, then add salt, pepper, paprika, and Sazonador

    Goya rubbing it in uniformly.

-   Convection roast on 425F for about 45 minutes to and hour until

    juices run clear and internal temperature of thickest parts are

    160F.

-   Cut the chicken into quarter sections and serve.
