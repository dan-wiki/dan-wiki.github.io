## Directions

-   Mix all compound butter ingredients together in a bowl until they
    are uniformly distributed in the butter. Careful to add the lemon
    juice slowly to not let it get too watery. It's still useable if it
    is liquidy. You can also use a small food processor for this step.

    breast plate and pressing until it breaks. You can look up how to do
    this on YouTube.

    butter.

-   Pat the skin dry with a paper towel and spread some of the butter on
    the top of the skin.
-   Rub a little olive oil on the skin if butter is not evenly
    distributed across it, then add salt, pepper, paprika, and Sazonador
    Goya rubbing it in uniformly.
-   Convection roast on 425F for about 45 minutes to and hour until
    juices run clear and internal temperature of thickest parts are
    160F.
