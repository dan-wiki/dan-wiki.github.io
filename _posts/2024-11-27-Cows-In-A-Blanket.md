1. **Prepare the Ingredients**:
   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
   - Open the package of crescent rolls and separate the dough into 8 individual triangles.
   - Cut each beef frank in half for smaller bites or leave whole for larger portions.

2. **Assemble the Pigs in a Blanket**:
   - Place one beef frank (or half) at the wide end of a crescent triangle.
   - Roll the dough around the frank, starting from the wide end and tucking in the sides slightly as you roll.
   - Repeat with all the franks and dough triangles.

3. **Bake**:
   - Arrange the rolled pieces on a parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving space between them.
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crescent dough is golden brown.

4. **Serve**:
   - Let cool slightly before serving.
   - Offer with your favorite dips like mustard, ketchup, or melted cheese.
