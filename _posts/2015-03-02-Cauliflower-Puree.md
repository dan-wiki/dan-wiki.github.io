## Ingredients

-   1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   1 clove garlic, smashed
-   1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
-   1 tablespoon reduced-fat cream cheese
-   1 teaspoon kosher salt
-   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper



## Directions

1.  Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just

    below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add

    cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes.

2.  Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook

    and stir garlic until softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.

3.  Transfer half the cauliflower to a food processor; cover and blend

    on high. Add remaining cauliflower florets, one at a time, until

    vegetables are creamy. Blend in garlic, Parmesan cheese, cream

    cheese, salt, and black pepper.
