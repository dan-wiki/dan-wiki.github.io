## Ingredients

-   1 12-20 pound turkey
-   1 onion , peeled and quartered
-   1 lemon , quartered
-   1 apple (your favorite kind), quartered
-   .75 ounce container fresh rosemary
-   .75 ounce container fresh thyme
-   .75 ounce container fresh sage
-   x2 Disposable Roasting Pan


**Note:**

-   To substitute dried herbs, use 1 teaspoon dried herbs per 1

    tablespoon fresh chopped herbs.


**For the herb butter:**

-   1 cup unsalted butter , softened
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
-   6-8 cloves garlic , minced
-   fresh chopped herbs


## Instructions

1.  If the turkey is frozen: Thaw in the fridge, 24 hours for every 5

    pounds of Turkey. I like to give myself 1 extra day, just to be

    safe.

2.  Remove the thawed turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting, to

    let it come to room temperature.

3.  For Disposable Roasting Pan: Place fresh chopped vegetables on the

    bottom of the pan to act as a rack to elevate the turkey. Use 4-5

    ribs of celery and 4 large carrots, roughly chopped.

4.  Adjust your oven rack so the turkey will sit in the center of the

    oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

5.  Make the herb butter by combining room temperature butter, minced

    garlic, salt, pepper, one tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary, one

    tablespoon fresh chopped thyme, and half a tablespoon of fresh

    chopped sage. (You'll use the remaining fresh herbs for stuffing

    inside the cavity of the turkey)

6.  Remove turkey from packaging and remove the neck and giblets from

    the inside the cavities of the bird. (Reserve them for gravy, if you

    want, or discard them). Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels.

7.  Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Stuff it with

    the quartered lemon, onion and apple and leftover herbs.

8.  Use your fingers to loosen and lift the skin above the breasts (on

    the top of the turkey) and smooth a few tablespoons of the herb

    butter underneath.

9.  Tuck the wings of the turkey underneath the turkey and set the

    turkey on a roasting rack inside a roasting pan\*.

10. Microwave the remaining herb butter mixture for 30 seconds (it

    doesn't need to be completely melted\--just really softened). Use a

    basting brush to brush the remaining herb butter all over the

    outside of the turkey, legs and wings.

11. Roast convection at 325 degrees F for about 13 minutes per pound, or

    until internal temperature (inserted on middle of thigh and breast)

    reaches about 165 degrees.

12. Check the turkey about halfway through cooking, and once the skin

    gets golden brown, cover the top of the turkey with tinfoil, to

    protect the breast meat from overcooking.

13. Remove the turkey from the oven once it reaches 160 degrees. Then, I

    tent it with foil, and let it rest on the counter. It will continue

    cooking under the foil, to reach 165 degrees F.

14. Allow turkey to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving.
